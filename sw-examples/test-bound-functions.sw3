-- test code for our new bound functions:
-- though I think they are slower than I would like!

-- define one:
fn {the|subject>, the |object>} #=>
    print the |subject>
    print the |object>


-- invoke it:
fn(|alpha>, |beta>)


-- define a single line function:
bah {the|next subject>} #=> print the |next subject>

-- now invoke it:
bah(|gamma>)


-- invoke it again, this time with an explicit input sequence:
fn(|one>, |two>) ssplit[" "] |some input sequence>
